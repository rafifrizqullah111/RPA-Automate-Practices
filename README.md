# 📘 Power Automate Desktop Learning Repository
👋 Welcome!

Hi there, and welcome to my personal Power Automate Desktop (PAD) learning repository.
This repo is created as a structured collection of practices, experiments, and notes while I learn and explore PAD automation.

It is not a production-ready project, but rather a space to keep track of my progress, organize exercises, and build hands-on experience in RPA development with PAD.

# 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- To document my learning journey with Power Automate Desktop.
- To provide a centralized place for different automation practices (Excel, Email, Web, API, Database, etc.).
- To act as a personal reference whenever I revisit topics or prepare for real-world projects.
