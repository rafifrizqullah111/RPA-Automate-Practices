# ðŸ“˜ Machine Management

This chapter focuses on managing and orchestrating automations in Power Automate Desktop.  
The cases are designed to cover machine resource usage, scheduling, monitoring, logging, and error handling to ensure automations run efficiently and reliably.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Schedule Automation on a Local Machine
- **Objective:** Configure and trigger PAD flows automatically at specific times.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**  
  - Create a simple PAD flow.  
  - Schedule execution via Power Automate or Windows Task Scheduler.  
  - Verify execution logs.  
- **Skills Covered:** Scheduling, unattended execution, log inspection.  

### 02. Manage Concurrent Processes
- **Objective:** Handle multiple PAD flows running on the same machine without conflict.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**  
  - Launch two flows with overlapping tasks (e.g., Excel + Web scraping).  
  - Use resource locks/semaphores to avoid conflicts.  
  - Ensure proper completion order.  
- **Skills Covered:** Concurrency handling, resource locking, process coordination.  

### 03. Centralized Logging and Monitoring
- **Objective:** Implement logging for PAD flows to capture success/failure events.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**  
  - Write logs to a central Excel/Database file.  
  - Capture key details (flow name, timestamp, status, error message).  
  - Build a simple monitoring dashboard (Excel pivot/Power BI).  
- **Skills Covered:** Logging, monitoring, data visualization.  

### 04. Error Handling and Recovery
- **Objective:** Design PAD flows with robust error management.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**  
  - Add Try-Catch blocks to capture runtime exceptions.  
  - Implement retry logic for transient errors.  
  - Send notification (email/Teams) upon failure.  
- **Skills Covered:** Exception handling, retry policies, notification integration.  

### 05. Multi-Machine Orchestration (Advanced)
- **Objective:** Distribute workloads across multiple machines.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**  
  - Configure multiple machines in Power Automate.  
  - Assign jobs dynamically to available machines.  
  - Track execution status across environments.  
- **Skills Covered:** Orchestration, scaling, environment management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these hands-on cases, you will learn:

- How to schedule and monitor automations on single or multiple machines.  
- Techniques to handle concurrent execution and resource conflicts.  
- Best practices in logging, exception handling, and recovery.  
- How to scale automations through multi-machine orchestration.
