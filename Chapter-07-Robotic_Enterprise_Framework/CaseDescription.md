# ðŸ“˜ Robotic Enterprise Framework (PAD)

This chapter introduces the Robotic Enterprise (RE) Framework concept in Power Automate Desktop.  
It emphasizes building structured, maintainable, and reusable automations that can scale from simple projects to enterprise-grade transactional workflows.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Build a Simple RE Framework Skeleton
- **Objective:** Create a lightweight RE Framework structure for single-run automation processes.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**
  - Define the main stages: `Init`, `Process Transaction`, `End Process`.
  - Implement logging messages to track execution flow.
  - Build a sample process (e.g., open Notepad, write text, save a file).
- **Skills Covered:** Framework structure, modular subflows, logging, project organization.

### 02. Extend Framework for Transactional Processing
- **Objective:** Expand the skeleton into a full RE Framework capable of handling multiple transactions.  
- **Hands-on Tasks:**
  - Add `Get Transaction Data` stage to fetch transactions from Excel rows.
  - Loop through transactions and process them one by one.
  - Implement error handling, retries, and logging for failed transactions.
  - Generate a summary report (success vs failed).
- **Skills Covered:** Transactional design, error handling, retry logic, Excel as transaction queue, reporting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these 2 hands-on cases, you will learn:

- How to structure Power Automate Desktop projects using RE Framework principles.  
- The difference between single-run (simple) vs transactional (scalable) automations.  
- Implementing logging, modularization, and error handling.  
- Using Excel as a transaction queue to simulate enterprise workflows.  
- Building a foundation for maintainable and scalable real-world automation projects.
